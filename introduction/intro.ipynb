    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Source: [python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *interpreted*: no compilation (contrary to Java, C/C++, Fortran)\n",
    "- *object-oriented*: based on the concept of objects, associated with attributes (object's data) and methods (object's procedures).\n",
    "- *high-level*: close to human languages (contrary to C, which is a middle-level language)\n",
    "- *dynamic semantics*: no variable declaration, possibility to mix-up data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantages of using Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Presence of third-party modules ([Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/))\n",
    "- Extensive support libraries (NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics)\n",
    "- Open source and community development\n",
    "- Easy to learn\n",
    "- User-friendly data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.)\n",
    "- Portable and Interactive\n",
    "- Portable across Operating Systems\n",
